The ModSx is simple but not simplistic, it’s a cross between the Arduino and a modular synths. 

V2.0 is a redesign of V1.0 - Instead of stacking like Arduino; the modules sit side by side.
This allows for more vertical mounted components, banana plugs, vert pots etc...

It is very much in it's infancy.
