ModSx-V2.0
==========

The ModSx is open open source form factor for modular synths. 

V2.0 is a redesign of V1.0 - Instead of stacking like Arduino; the modules sit side by side.
This allows for more vertical mounted components, banana plugs, vert pots etc...

It is very much in it's infancy.

I've rolled the power and proto board into one, it now uses a standard ATX computer PSU and everything is fused properly.
